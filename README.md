## Directory Details

- **`event/`**: Contains the two different approaches for generating arrival events using Poisson processes
- **`models/`**: Includes the linked list data structure (provided by professor) and the Result struct to represent simulation results
- **`outputs/`**: Directory to store simulation results (average, theoretical average, histogram, lambda, and number of events) - files are read by the Python script
- **`plots/`**: Directory that contains histogram plots generated after running the Python script
- **`scripts/`**: Contains the Python script to read files from outputs directory and create plots in the plots directory
- **`main.c`**: Entry point that runs both simulation methods and saves results to files

## Usage

1. **Compile:** `make`
2. **Run simulations:** `./main`
3. **Generate plots:** `cd scripts && uv run build_hist.py`

Results will be saved in `outputs/` and plots in `plots/`.
